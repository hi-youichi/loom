  - Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size
  - Supports glob patterns like "**/*.js" or "src/**/*.ts"
  - Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
  - Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
  - When you are doing an open-ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead
  - You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.
