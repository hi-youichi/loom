description: |
  Apply multiple find-and-replace edits to a single file in one call. Prefer over edit when
  making several changes to the same file.

  Before using:
  1. Use the Read tool to understand the file contents.
  2. Verify the path is correct.

  - path: file to modify (relative to working folder).
  - edits: array of { oldString, newString, replaceAll? }. Applied in order; all or none (atomic).
  - Same rules as edit: exact match, replaceAll for renames, no line-number prefix in strings.
