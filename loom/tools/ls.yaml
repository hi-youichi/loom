name: ls
description: |
  Lists files and directories in a given path, rendered as a tree. The path parameter
  is relative to the working folder; omit it (or use ".") to list the working folder root.
  You can optionally provide an array of glob patterns to ignore with the ignore parameter.
  Common build/dependency directories (node_modules, target, .git, dist, etc.) are ignored
  by default. Results are capped at 100 files. You should generally prefer the Glob and Grep
  tools if you know which directories to search.
