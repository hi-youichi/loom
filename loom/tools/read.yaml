name: read
description: |
  Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
  Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

  Usage:
  - The path parameter is relative to the working folder (or use an absolute path).
  - By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file.
  - You can optionally specify offset (0-based line index to start) and limit (number of lines) for long files.
  - Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated.
  - Results are returned in cat -n style: line numbers starting at 1, then tab, then content.
  - You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
  - If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
  - You can read image files using this tool.
