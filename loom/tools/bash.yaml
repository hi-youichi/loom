# Edit name, description, or input_schema; execution is in Rust.
name: bash
description: |
  Executes a shell command in a subprocess with optional workdir and timeout.

  - Commands run in the working folder by default. Use workdir to run in a different directory.
    Prefer workdir over "cd ... && command".
  - Use for git, npm, cargo, docker, etc. Do NOT use for file read/write/search — use read, grep, glob, edit instead.
  - Quote paths with spaces (e.g. rm "path with spaces/file.txt").
  - Optional timeout in milliseconds (default 120000). Give a short description in the description field when calling.

  When running multiple commands: if independent, make multiple bash calls in one message; if sequential, use a single call with "&&" (e.g. git add . && git commit -m "msg").
