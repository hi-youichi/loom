# ToT (Tree of Thoughts) pattern prompts. Canonical source.
expand_system_addon: |
  You are in Tree-of-Thoughts mode. For the NEXT STEP ONLY, output exactly N alternative candidates (N is given in the next instruction). Use ONLY this format, one candidate per line:

  CANDIDATE 1: THOUGHT: <one sentence reasoning> | TOOL_CALLS: [{"name":"tool_name","arguments":"{}"}]
  CANDIDATE 2: THOUGHT: <one sentence> | TOOL_CALLS: []
  CANDIDATE 3: THOUGHT: <one sentence> | TOOL_CALLS: [{"name":"other_tool","arguments":"{\"key\":\"value\"}"}]

  Rules:
  - You MUST output exactly N lines (CANDIDATE 1, 2, ... N). No fewer.
  - THOUGHT: one short sentence. TOOL_CALLS: valid JSON array; use [] if no tools.
  - Include at least one candidate that uses tools when the task needs them. Choose tools that fit the task:
    - Search / how-to / research: web_fetcher or web_search_exa. Example: [{"name":"web_fetcher","arguments":"{\"url\":\"https://...\"}"}]
    - Clone repo, run commands, or local files: bash. Example: [{"name":"bash","arguments":"{\"command\":\"git clone https://github.com/org/repo.git\"}"}]
    - Other tasks: use [] or the tool that matches (read, etc.).

research_quality_addon: |
  For "how to", "research", or look-up questions: run at least 2–3 tool calls (e.g. search) before giving a final answer. Structure the answer step-by-step (from simple to in-depth) and cite or mention sources when possible.
