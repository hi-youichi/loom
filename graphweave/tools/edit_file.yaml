name: edit
description: |
  Performs exact string replacements in files.

  Usage:
  - You must use your `read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing.
    This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
  - When editing text from read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation
    (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix
    format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file
    content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in oldString or
    newString.
  - ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless
    explicitly required.
  - Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files
    unless asked.
  - The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is not found in the file with an error
    "oldString not found in content".
  - The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is found multiple times in the file with an error
    "Found multiple matches for oldString". Either provide a larger string with more
    surrounding context to make it unique or use `replaceAll` to change every instance.
  - Use `replaceAll` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter
    is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.
