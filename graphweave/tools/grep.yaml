  - Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size
  - Searches file contents using regular expressions
  - Supports full regex syntax (e.g. "log.*Error", "function\s+\w+", etc.)
  - Filter files by pattern with the include parameter (e.g. "*.rs", "*.{ts,tsx}")
  - Returns file paths and line numbers with at least one match sorted by modification time
  - Use this tool when you need to find files containing specific patterns
  - If you need to identify/count the number of matches within files, use the Bash tool with `rg` (ripgrep) directly
  - When you are doing an open-ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead
  - You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.
